# Connect 4 (Java)

## Description
A two-player Connect 4 game developed in Java with a graphical interface using Java AWT and Swing. Implements core game logic with object-oriented design, recursive win detection, and input validation. Designed to simulate the traditional Connect 4 gameplay experience in an interactive environment.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Two-player alternating turns with colored discs.
- **Game Logic:** Drop pieces into columns with automatic gravity simulation.
- **Win Detection:** Recursive algorithm checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections of four.
- **Board Representation:** 2D array structure (6Ã—7 grid by default) for game state tracking.
- **GUI Interface:** Visual board and user interaction implemented using Java Swing components.
- **Reset Functionality:** Option to restart the game after a win or tie.

## Implementation Highlights
- **Language:** Java
- **Design Approach:** Object-oriented design principles
- **Algorithms:** Recursive win-checking and array-based state management
- **Libraries:** AWT and Swing for GUI rendering and event handling

## User Interaction
1. Launch the game window.
2. Players alternate dropping colored discs by selecting a column.
3. The game automatically detects and displays wins or ties.
4. Players can reset and start a new game.

## About
A Java-based recreation of the classic Connect 4 game developed as part of an academic project. Demonstrates strong understanding of recursion, arrays, and object-oriented programming, combined with GUI development using Java Swing and AWT.
